# Property fair demo

Note: This project is only for the educational purpose.

In this project I have used laravel 9, vue 3 and inertia Js for the fullstack development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. `cd project`
3. Install all the dependencies using composer `composer install`
4. Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file
    
    `cp .env.example .env`

5. Generate a new application key `php artisan key:generate`

6. Run the migration and seed data `php artisan migrate --seed`

7. Create the symbolic link to storage `php artisan storage:link`

8. Run `npm install && npm run dev`

9. Run `php artisan serve`

now we can see the development server started at `http:localhost:8000/`

#### Happy Coding...
